# State file is very important for Terraform.
# The state file is a JSON representation of the infrastructure you have deployed in the cloud.
# There are 3 different ways to store the state file. 1- it is stored locally on your machine. 2- it is stored in a 3rd party storage like a s3 bucket (which is the case for this project). 3- to store it in the Terraform cloud.
